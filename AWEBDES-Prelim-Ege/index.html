                        <hr>
                        <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of design and
                            evolve,
                            something we hope
                            we're doing constantly. A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of
                            photographers,
                            designers, and creatives who
                            enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country, we take time to document the
                            cities
                            we love. You'l also
                            occasionaly find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting
                            on
                            photography.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur
                            photographers. We submit these
                            galleries out of love and creative expression. We're not likely to remember the settings we
                            took
                            the picture at, or even what
                            lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to
                            participate, we'd love to have you. All
                            galeries, articles, and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're
                            interested, drop us a line and tel us
                            what you have in mind.
                            <br><br>
                            We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami, we'l let
                            everyone know and schedule
                            a meet up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city, <span
